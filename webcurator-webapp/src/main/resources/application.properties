# The active profile. For example, 'local+h2' will use application-local+h2.properties to override the properties found
# in this file. This can also be set on the command line using: -Dspring.profile.active=local+h2
# NOTE: The name of the active profile cannot have dashes in it -- spring may parse the override name incorrectly.
#       This means that a file name of application-local-h2.properties with a spring.profiles.active=local-h2 will not work.

# If the artifact is a jar, spring, by default rejects: Paths that contain "WEB-INF" or "META-INF"
# But if the artifact is a war, it appears that WEB-INF is acceptable. This may be due to how the
# embedded tomcat processes jar vs. war artifacts.
