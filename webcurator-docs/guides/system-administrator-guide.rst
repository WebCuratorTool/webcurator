Getting Started
=====================

The following section explains how to get the Web Curator Tool up and
running.

Prerequisites
----------------------------

The following are required to successfully install and run the Web
Curator Tool:

-  Java 1.8 JDK or above (64bit recommended)

-  A database server (supported versions in parenthesis)

   -  Oracle (11g, 12c)

   -  PostgreSQL (8.4.9, 9.6.11)

   -  MySQL (5.0.95 or newer)

   -  MariaDB (10.0.36)

Other versions of the required products may be compatible with the Web
Curator Tool but they have not been tested. Due to the products use of
Hibernate for database persistence other database platforms should work,
if the product is rebuilt with the correct database dialect. However
only Postgesql, Oracle, MySQL and MariaDB have been tested.

Supported platforms
-------------------

The following platforms have been used during the development of the Web
Curator Tool:

-  Red Hat Linux EL3.

-  Ubuntu GNU/Linux 16.04, 18.04 LTS

-  Mint GNU/Linux 19.1 LTS

-  Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 10

Other platforms
---------------

The following platforms were used during the Development of the Web
Curator tool but are not explicitly supported:

-  Sun Solaris 10

Optional prerequisites
----------------------

The following prerequisites are optional:

-  LDAP compliant directory (for external authentication)

-  Apache Maven 3+ (required to build from source).

-  Gradle 5.6 (required to build from source; other versions *may* also work).

-  Git (can be used to clone the project source from Github)

Setting up the WCT database
===========================


Setup using Oracle
------------------

*This guide assumes you have installed and configured Oracle prior to
setting up the WCT database and schema.*

1. Setup two schemas: one called DB_WCT that owns the tables and one
   called USR_WCT that the application uses to query the tables. The
   USR_WCT schema should have limited rights. You can use the
   following SQL script to do this::

    db/latest/setup/wct-create-oracle.sql


2. Run the following SQL scripts under the DB_WCT user or SYSTEM
   account::

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-oracle.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-grants.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-indexes-oracle.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-bootstrap-oracle.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-qa-data-oracle.sql

*The wct-qa-data-oracle.sql script will generate QA indicator
template data for the new QA module for each agency, and should be run*
**once all agencies have been added to WCT**. *Note that if the script is
re-run, it will clear out any existing template data.*

3. A password strategy should be defined for the system, and the
   db_wct & usr_wct passwords should be changed in the scripts and
   application property files to conform to this strategy. To encourage
   this, the passwords in the supplied database creation script are set
   to 'password'.

   The bootstrap user script creates a User with a name of 'bootstrap' and
   a password of 'password'. Use this account to login to the application
   once it is up and running. You can use the bootstrap account to create
   other users and agencies. Once you have setup valid users, it is best to
   disable the bootstrap user for security reasons.

Setup using PostgreSQL
----------------------------

*This guide assumes you have installed and configured PostgreSQL
prior to setting up the WCT database and schema.*

1. Create the database, using the following script::

    db/latest/setup/wct-create-postgres.sql


2. Run the following SQL scripts under the DB_WCT user or SYSTEM
   account::

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-postgres.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-grants-postgres.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-indexes-postgres.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-bootstrap-postgres.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-qa-data-postgres.sql

*The wct-qa-data-postgres.sql script will generate QA indicator
template data for the new QA module for each agency, and should be run*
**once all agencies have been added to WCT**. *Note that if the script is
re-run, it will clear out any existing template data.*

3. A password strategy should be defined for the system, and the
   db_wct & usr_wct passwords should be changed in the scripts and
   application property files to conform to this strategy. To encourage
   this, the passwords in the supplied database creation script are set
   to 'password'.

   The bootstrap user script creates a User with a name of 'bootstrap' and
   a password of 'password'. Use this account to login to the application
   once it is up and running. You can use the bootstrap account to create
   other users and agencies. Once you have setup valid users, it is best to
   disable the bootstrap user for security reasons.

Setup using MySQL
-----------------

This guide assumes you have installed and configured MySQL prior
to setting up the WCT database and schema.

1. Create the database, using the following script::

    db/latest/setup/wct-create-mysql.sql


2. Run the following SQL scripts under the DB_WCT user or SYSTEM
   account::

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-mysql.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-schema-grants-mysql.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-indexes-mysql.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-bootstrap-mysql.sql

    db/latest/sql/wct-qa-data-mysql.sql


*The wct-qa-data-mysql.sql script will generate QA indicator template
data for the new QA module for each agency, and should be run* **once all
agencies have been added to WCT**. *Note that if the script is re-run, it
will clear out any existing template data.*

3. A password strategy should be defined for the system, and the
   db_wct & usr_wct passwords should be changed in the scripts and
   application property files to conform to this strategy. To encourage
   this, the passwords in the supplied database creation script are set
   to 'password'.

   The bootstrap user script creates a User with a name of 'bootstrap' and
   a password of 'password'. Use this account to login to the application
   once it is up and running. You can use the bootstrap account to create
   other users and agencies. Once you have setup valid users, it is best to
   disable the bootstrap user for security reasons.


Setting up the WCT Application
==============================

Downloading WCT
---------------
The binaries for the WCT components can be downloaded from the
`releases page in the Github repository <https://github.com/WebCuratorTool/webcurator/releases>`_.

Building WCT
------------
Alternatively, WCT can be built from source.

To build WCT:

- Make sure you have installed and configured Java 1.8 JDK, Maven 3+, Gradle 4.4+ and Git.

- Clone the code repository from Github using Git::

   git clone https://github.com/WebCuratorTool/webcurator.git

- Navigate to the *webcurator-legacy-lib-dependencies/* sub-directory, and run either of
  the following scripts (depending on your operating system) to install the required
  legacy dependencies::

   - install_maven_dependencies.bat
   - install_maven_dependencies.sh

- Navigate back to the root *webcurator* directory, and build the project using Gradle::

   gradle clean install

- Once built, the binary for each component will be located under the following paths::

   - webcurator-webapp/build/libs/webcurator-webapp.war
   - webcurator-store/build/libs/webcurator-store.war
   - webcurator-harvest-agent-h3/build/libs/webcurator-harvest-agent-h3.jar

Deploying WCT
-------------

There are three major components to the deployment of the Web Curator
Tool:

-  Webapp (webcurator-webapp.war)
-  Digital Asset Store (webcurator-store.war).
-  Harvest Agent (harvest-agent-h3.jar)

Each of these three components must be deployed for the Web Curator
Tool to be fully functional and more than one harvest agent can be
deployed if necessary. Each Harvest Agent is capable of carrying out
harvest actions. The more harvest agents are deployed the more harvesting
can be done concurrently. The harvest agents and digital asset store can
reside on any machine within the network, as they use REST over HTTP
to communicate with each other.

To deploy WCT:

-  Make sure you have installed and configured Java 1.8 JDK.

-  Make sure you have installed and configured your database of choice, and
   that it is now running.

-  Place the webapp, store and harvest-agent binaries in the location you wish
   to run them from. An additional logs directory will be created here on startup.

-  Start the WCT files using a standard Java command::

    java -jar webcurator-webapp.war
    java -jar webcurator-store.war
    java -jar harvest-agent-h3.jar

   These commands can be run in the foreground for testing, but it is
   recommended to run them in the background, using a tool like Unix's
   *nohup* command. Note that you will likely need to configure WCT
   to suit your environment, see `Configuring WCT properties`_.

-  To stop any WCT component, simply terminate the running process, or if running
   in the foreground, simply use *Ctrl+c*.

-  Before logging into WCT, *ensuring all components are shutdown*, modify the
   configuration files in the following steps.

Additional command line properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional properties can be passed to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for WCT on the command line. For
instance, the maximum allowed memory a WCT component can use::

    java -Xmx512m -jar webcurator-webapp.war

- **Memory**

    Increased memory allocation for Webapp and Store may be required if performance
    issues are experienced with the harvest visualization feature from v3.1 onwards.
    This can be dependent on the size of harvests and whether all the WCT components and
    Heritrix are running on a single server.

Configuring WCT properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inside each component binary, there is an **application.properties** file which contains configuration
properties for WCT::

   - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties
   - webcurator-store.war/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties
   - harvest-agent-h3.jar/BOOT-INF/classes/application.properties


Modify the properties in **application.properties**, and restart the corresponding WCT component for them
to take effect.

The properties can also be overridden, using a local Spring application profile
(e.g. *application-local.properties, application-local+mysql.properties*). This provides flexibility for
configuring WCT in different environments and settings. The profile filename must use the structure
**application**-``<profile name>`` **.properties**. By default, webcurator-webapp.war, contains several example
profiles that can be used and customized for the Webapp::

   - application-local+h2.properties
   - application-local+mysql.properties
   - application-local+oracle.properties
   - application-local+postgres.properties


*Also, see Appendix B for an extended Spring Profile override example*

To change the profile loaded with a WCT component at runtime, either

-  Inside the WCT component binary, open the **application.properties** file for editing. Set
   the *spring.profiles.active* property to the profile name to be loaded, then save **application.properties**::

      E.g.
      - spring.profiles.active=local+postgres
      - spring.profiles.active=dev+mysql+ldap

   Ensure a corresponding profile with the correct filename is located in the same folder::

      E.g.
      - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application-local+postgres.properties
      - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application-dev+mysql+ldap.properties

-  Or, set the profile when running the WCT component. The corresponding profile can be located inside
   the WCT binary or outside it, in the same directory::

      java -jar webcurator-webapp.war --spring.profiles.active=local+mysql

*Note: If you do not wish to edit the binaries, you can actually override any application.properties file inside the 
binaries, by creating a file of the same name (e.g. 'application.properties', 'application-local+mysql.properties')
inside the directory where you run the java command. You only need to add the variables that you wish to override.
Spring Boot will pick up the other variables from the namesake file inside the binary. This goes for all three
components.*

Configure TLS/SSL access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since you will be sending credentials over potentially untrusted networks when you login, it is wise to configure 
the Webapp to use TLS/SSL. To do so you need to create a keystore containing the certificate for your server, 
using a tool such Java's *keytool*. (The process of acquiring and importing a CA-signed certificate is outside 
of the scope of this document.) Then add the following properties to the relevant application properties file::

   # The format used for the keystore. It could be set to JKS in case it is a JKS file
   server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
   # The path to the keystore containing the certificate
   server.ssl.key-store=wct.p12
   # The password used to generate the certificate
   server.ssl.key-store-password=password
   # The alias mapped to the certificate
   server.ssl.key-alias=wct
   
   # forces ssl
   server.ssl.enabled=true
   
   server.port=8043

Note that *key-store* is a filepath relative to the working directory of the *java* command used to run the application. 
The *key-alias* should match the alias you used when adding the certificate to the keystore (with keytool's *-alias* 
argument). You should also update the *harvestCoordinatorNotifier.baseUrl* and the *webapp.baseUrl* properties in the 
application.properties of the Harvest Agents and the Store (respectively) to reflect the changed *server.port* and 
the 'https' URL scheme of Webapp.

TODO: This will not work for self-signed certificates. Additional configuration of Harvest Agents and Store is required.

Configure the Database Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Inside webcurator-webapp.war, open the properties profile that corresponds to the database
   type you are using::

      E.g.
      - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application-local+mysql.properties
      - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application-local+oracle.properties
      - webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/application-local+postgres.properties

   Adjust the following properties to match your database installation::

      # Database properties
      databaseType=postgres
      schema.name=db_wct
      schema.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Dwct
      schema.user=usr_wct
      schema.password=password
      schema.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
      schema.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQL82Dialect
      schema.query=select 1+1
      schema.maxIdle=2
      schema.maxActive=4

   *If the default WCT database scripts have been used to setup the database then the* **name** and **user**,
   *properties should* **not** *need to be changed. You are of course* **strongly encouraged** *to change the default*
   **password**. *Verify the* **url** *and* **dialect** *properties match the location and version of your database.*

   Update this properties file inside webcurator-webapp.war with any changes.

-  Load the Spring profile for your database configuration, either by setting the *spring.profiles.active*
   property inside the **application.properties** file, or through the commandline::

      java -jar webcurator-webapp.war --spring.profiles.active=local+postgres


Configure LDAP Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If you wish to use an external Directory for Authentication, then WCT can be configured to
   allow this. Unencrypted authentication can be done very simply with your directory by
   modifying the relevant properties file inside webcurator-webapp.war.

   *Please note - the Directory must support LDAP.*

   Open the **application.properties** file inside webcurator-webapp.war, or a local Spring
   application profile if one is being used.

   Locate the *# LDAP properties* section, or add it if using a local Spring
   application profile::

      # LDAP properties
      ldap.enabled=false
      ldap.url.build=ldap://yourldapserver.domain.com:389/
      ldap.usr.search.base=ou=people
      ldap.usr.search.filter=(uid={0})
      ldap.group.search.base=ou=groups
      ldap.group.search.filter=(member={0})
      ldap.contextsource.root=dc=com
      ldap.contextsource.manager.dn=
      ldap.contextsource.manager.password=


   Set *ldap.enabled* to true to enable LDAP Authentication::

      ldap.enabled=true

   Initially set the following two parameters:

   -  *ldap.url.build*, which defines the URL for the directory. This is normally
      something like ldap://mydirectory.natlib.co.nz:<port-number>

   -  *ldap.contextsource.manager.dn*. This allows the Directory DN to be
      defined. For example, if a user logs in with the username "gordonp"
      the Directory will be queried using the distinguished name of "cn=gordonp, ou=wct,
      o=global". So the user must exist within the global organisation and
      the wct organisation unit.

   *Set any other required parameters, and remove any unneeded default values.*

Configure LDAP Authentication (Encrypted using TLS or SSL)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If you want all credentials passed to the Directory server to be
   protected then the ldap traffic should be encrypted using TLS or SSL.

   - The scheme prefix **ldaps** is required in the *ldap.url* property::

        ldap.url=ldaps://yourldaphost.domain.com:389

   - If using TLS or SSL then you must configure the application to allow secure
     communication with your Directory by adding the following properties to the
     application.profile of the Webapp::

        server.ssl.trust-store=/var/wctcore/ssl/wct.ts
        server.ssl.trust-store-password=password
        server.ssl.client-auth=need


     This points Spring Boot to a Truststore that contains the public key for you
     directory. If your directory utilises a correctly signed certificate,
     you may not need this, as the default truststore provided by Java
     contains all the major root certificates. However if you directory uses
     a self-signed certificate then you will need to export the public key of
     that certificate and import it into your truststore (i.e.
     /var/wctcore/ssl/wct.ts). Alternatively you can import the self-signed
     certificate into the default Java truststore.

     *For details on how to create a truststore and import a certificate,
     see Appendix A: Creating a truststore and importing a certificate.*

Configure the Digital Asset Store (DAS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Inside webcurator-store.war, open the **application.properties** file for editing::

    webcurator-store.war/WEB-INF/classes/application.properties

   Set the *server.port* property to an open port on the server that the Digital Asset Store (DAS)
   will run on::

    server.port=8082

   Set the Base Directory of the DAS to a valid location on the server. Also make
   sure the directory or shared folder has enough free disk space::

      # The base directory of the Digital Asset Store
      arc.store.dir=/usr/local/wct/store

   Set the base URL (scheme, host, port and context) connection details for the Webapp::

      # the base service url of Webapp
      webapp.baseUrl=http://localhost:8080/wct

   Update the **application.properties** file inside webcurator-store.war with any change.

-  Alternatively, set the above parameters in your DAS local Spring application profile, and override the
   default values in **application.properties**.

-  Open the **application.properties** file inside webcurator-webapp.war, or the local Spring
   application profile if one is being used.

   Set the base URL (scheme, host and port) connection details for the DAS::

      # the base service url of the digital asset store
      digitalAssetStore.baseUrl=http://localhost:8082

   Set the directory for transferring assets to the Digital Asset Store. Make sure the directory is a valid
   location on the server and has enough free disk space::

      # the folder for transferring assets to the Digital Asset Store
      digitalAssetStoreServer.uploadedFilesDir=/usr/local/wct/store/uploadedFiles/

   Update the **application.properties** file inside webcurator-webapp.war with any change.

Configure a Heritrix 3 - Harvest Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Inside harvest-agent-h3.jar, open the **application.properties** file for editing::

      harvest-agent-h3.jar\BOOT-INF\classes\application.properties

   Set the *server.port* property to an open port on the server that the Harvest Agent will run on::

      server.port=8083

   Set the Base Directory of the Harvest Agent to a valid location on the server::

      harvestAgent.baseHarvestDirectory=/usr/local/wct/harvest-agent

   *Note, the* ``harvestAgent.baseHarvestDirectory`` *path* **cannot** *match the Heritrix 3 jobs directory. This
   will cause a conflict within the H3 Harvest Agent.*

   Set the base URL (scheme, host, port and context) connection details for the Webapp::

      # the base service url of Webapp
      harvestCoordinatorNotifier.baseUrl=http://localhost:8080/wct

   Set the base URL (scheme, host, and port) connection details for the DAS::

      digitalAssetStore.baseUrl=http://localhost:8082

   If the Harvest Agent will be running on a different server to the DAS, then set the file upload mode to *stream*::

      # 1) copy: when Harvest Agent and Store Component are deployed on the same machine;
      # 2) stream: when Harvest Agent and Store Component are distributed deployed on different machines;
      digitalAssetStore.fileUploadMode=copy

   Make sure the following parameters match the Heritrix 3 instance details::

      # The H3 instance scheme.
      h3Wrapper.scheme=https
      # The H3 instance host.
      h3Wrapper.host=localhost
      # The H3 instance port.
      h3Wrapper.port=8443
      # The H3 instance full path and filename for the keystore file.
      h3Wrapper.keyStoreFile=''
      # The H3 instance password for the keyStore file
      h3Wrapper.keyStorePassword=''
      # The H3 instance userName.
      h3Wrapper.userName=admin
      # The H3 instance password.
      h3Wrapper.password=admin

   Update the **application.properties** file inside harvest-agent-h3.jar with any change.

-  Alternatively, set the above parameters in your Harvest Agent local Spring application profile, and
   override the default values in **application.properties**.

-  In addition to setting the Harvest Agent parameters, you may also want to change the default
   Heritrix v3 profile that is shipped with the WCT. See the `Default profile`_ section.


Logon to WCT
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have started up the Web Curator Tool logon to the application
using the 'bootstrap' user with the default password of 'password'. This
account has enough privilege to create other Agencies and Users within
the system. Once you have configured valid WCT users and tested their
login's work, you should disable the bootstrap user.

The URL to access WCT will be similar to the one displayed below:

   http://localhost:8080/wct/

Where 'localhost' can be replaced with your server, and 8080 with the configured Webapp port.


Troubleshooting setup

Configuration Options
---------------------

This section describes additional options for configuring the Web Curator Tool.



Webapp Configuration - application.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are common configuration options for the Webapp adjusted via the **application.properties** file.

-  Application Context

   The **server.servlet.contextPath** can be configured to run the Webapp from a custom application context. This
   context can be seen at the end of the WCT URL, http://localhost:8080/**wct**. Remember to also adjust the Webapp
   *baseUrl* configuration for the DAS and each Harvest Agent ::

      server.servlet.contextPath=/wct

-  Mail Server

   The **mailServer** is responsible for communicating with an SMTP
   mail server for sending email notifications ::

      mail.protocol=SMTP
      mailServer.smtp.host=yourhost.yourdomain.com
      mail.smtp.port=25

-  In Tray Manager

   The **inTrayManager** is responsible for informing users of Tasks or
   Notification messages. This uses the mailServer to send email. Also
   defined here is the sender of the automated system Tasks and notifications ::

      inTrayManager.sender=youremail@yourdomain.com
      inTrayManager.wctBaseUrl=${webapp.baseUrl}/

-  Harvest Coordination

   The **harvestCoordinator** is responsible for the coordination of
   harvest activity across all of the Harvest Agents. Defined in the Co-ordinator is
   the number of days before the Digital Asset Store is purged as well as the 
   number of days before data remaining after aborted harvests is purged ::

      harvestCoordinator.daysBeforeDASPurge=14
      harvestCoordinator.daysBeforeAbortedTargetInstancePurge=7

   The harvest coordinator is able to "optimize" harvests that are
   configured to be optimizable. Optimizable harvests will begin earlier
   than their scheduled time, when the harvests can support the extra
   harvest, and when the scheduled time is within the look-ahead window
   configuration. A number of harvesters can also be excluded from
   optimization, to allow for non-optimizable harvests to execute on
   schedule.

   Targets can be configured as optimizable on the target edit screen. ::

      harvestCoordinator.harvestOptimizationEnabled=true
      harvestCoordinator.harvestOptimizationLookaheadHours=12
      harvestCoordinator.numHarvestersExcludedFromOptimisation=1

   The **harvestAgentFactory** defines how many days in advance to generate
   future scheduled Target Instances ::

      harvestAgentFactory.daysToSchedule=90

-  Group Search Controller

   The **groupSearchController** defines how the default search is handled
   on the Groups tab. When **defaultSearchOnAgencyOnly** is set to *true*,
   the user name is omitted from the default Group search filter allowing
   the display of all groups for the current user's agency. When
   **defaultSearchOnAgencyOnly** is set to *false*, the user name is
   included in the filter and only those Groups owned by the current user
   are displayed ::

      groupSearchController.defaultSearchOnAgencyOnly=true

-  Archive Adapter

   The **archiveAdapter** The archive adapter provides the mechanism for
   archiving a harvested target instance into an archive repository. When
   **targetReferenceMandatory** is set to *true (or is omitted)*, the
   owning Target for a Target Instance being archived must have a Target
   Reference defined in order for archiving to be attempted. When
   **targetReferenceMandatory** is set to *false*, there is no need for the
   owning Target to have a Target Reference defined ::

      archiveAdapter.targetReferenceMandatory=false

-  Quality Review Settings

   The **QualityReviewToolController** settings control whether the
   standard browse tool, and external access tool, or both are available to
   the user. The **ArchiveUrl** setting specifies the location of the
   archive access tool, to allow the user to view copies of the target
   already stored in the archive. The **ArchiveName** is the name displayed
   on the review screen. The **archive.alternative** allows the use of a
   second review tool, with it’s corresponding name. The alternative can be
   commented out in the configuration if it is not required ::

      qualityReviewToolController.enableBrowseTool=true
      qualityReviewToolController.enableAccessTool=false
      qualityReviewToolController.archiveUrl=http://web.archive.org/web/*/
      qualityReviewToolController.archiveName=Wayback
      qualityReviewToolController.archive.alternative=http://web.archive.org/web/*/
      qualityReviewToolController.archive.alternative.name=Another Wayback

   The **harvestResourceUrlMapper** is responsible for writing the access
   tool URLs using a custom url and replacing elements of that url with the 
   correct items in the harvest resource.

   The urlMap property of the **harvestResourceUrlMapper** can have any of
   the following substituted value from the harvest resource ::

      {$HarvestResource.Name}
      {$HarvestResource.Length}
      {$HarvestResource.Oid}
      {$HarvestResource.StatusCode}
      {$ArcHarvestResource.FileDate}
      {$HarvestResult.CreationDate[,DateFormat]}
      {$HarvestResult.DerivedFrom}
      {$HarvestResult.HarvestNumber}
      {$HarvestResult.Oid}
      {$HarvestResult.ProvenanceNote}
      {$HarvestResult.State}

   The HarvestResult.CreationDate substitution's format can be controlled
   by supplying a valid `simple date
   format <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html>`__
   after a comma within the curly brackets e.g.
   {$HarvestResult.CreationDate,ddMMyy } for 1 Nov 2008 will show "011108" ::

      harvestResourceUrlMapper.urlMap=http://localhost:8090/wayback/{$ArcHarvestResource.FileDate}/{$HarvestResource.Name}

   The **QualityReviewController.enableAccessTool** and **HarvestResourceUrlMapper** settings can be used
   to allow Wayback to be used as an access tool for the WCT; either instead of, or in addition to the
   standard Browse tool. See :doc:`Wayback Integration Guide <wayback-integration-guide>`.

   *Note, that if Wayback is being used as an access tool, the
   WaybackIndexer must be enabled and configured (see Digital Asset Store configuration
   below and* :doc:`Wayback Integration Guide <wayback-integration-guide>`.

-  Heritrix 3

   Set the Heritrix major/minor version number that will be used with WCT. This version is displayed in the UI ::

      heritrix.version=3.4.0

   Set the directoy location of available H3 scripts. These scripts are available to users in the UI through
   the H3 scripting console. See `Scripts directory`_ under `Setting up Heritrix 3`_ ::

      h3.scriptsDirectory=/usr/local/wct/h3scripts

   The **PolitenessOptions** define the Heritrix 3 politeness settings. These values
   are shown in the UI when editing a Heritrix 3 profile, and are used to adjust
   whether a crawl will be performed in an aggressive, moderate or polite manner ::

      crawlPoliteness.polite.delayFactor=10.0
      crawlPoliteness.polite.minDelayMs=9000
      crawlPoliteness.polite.MaxDelayMs=90000
      crawlPoliteness.polite.respectCrawlDelayUpToSeconds=180
      crawlPoliteness.polite.maxPerHostBandwidthUsageKbSec=400

      crawlPoliteness.medium.delayFactor=5.0
      crawlPoliteness.medium.minDelayMs=3000
      crawlPoliteness.medium.MaxDelayMs=30000
      crawlPoliteness.medium.respectCrawlDelayUpToSeconds=30
      crawlPoliteness.medium.maxPerHostBandwidthUsageKbSec=800

      crawlPoliteness.aggressive.delayFactor=1.0
      crawlPoliteness.aggressive.minDelayMs=1000
      crawlPoliteness.aggressive.MaxDelayMs=10000
      crawlPoliteness.aggressive.respectCrawlDelayUpToSeconds=2
      crawlPoliteness.aggressive.maxPerHostBandwidthUsageKbSec=2000


-  Core Base Directory

   The **core.base.dir** defines a temporary working directory for harvest patching activities
   by the Webapp. The directory is used to store local files that have been imported into a
   harvest, as well as caching patching metadata. ::

      core.base.dir=/usr/local/wct/webapp/

-  Triggers

   The **processScheduleTrigger** defines when the heartbeat activity is
   checked on the registered Agents. The time is measured in milliseconds ::

      processScheduleTrigger.startDelay=10000
      processScheduleTrigger.repeatInterval=30000



Digital Asset Store - application.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are common configuration options for the DAS adjusted via the **application.properties** file.

-  DAS File Mover

   The **dasFileMover** defines how the DAS will move harvest files from the temporary attachments directory
   to the DAS base storage directory ::

      # For use when the DAS attachments directory is on a different filesystem than the store directory.
      arcDigitalAssetStoreService.dasFileMover=inputStreamDasFileMover
      # For use when the DAS attachments directory is on the same filesystem than the store directory.
      ##arcDigitalAssetStoreService.dasFileMover=renameDasFileMover

-  Additional Indexers

   This section of the file allows configuration of additional indexers, which run concurrently
   with the standard WCT indexer. There are currently three additional indexers available. 
   
   **WaybackIndexer** configures WCT to make copies of the ARC or WARC files and move them to
   the **waybackInputFolder** for automatic indexing by an installed Wayback instance. Wayback
   will eventually deposit a file of the same name in either the **waybackMergedFolder** (if successful)
   or the **waybackFailedFolder** (if unsuccessful). If **useSymLinks** is **true** the indexer will
   create symbolic ("soft") links to the warc files instead of copies inside the **waybackInputFolder** 
   to save space (default is false).
   The **WaybackIndexer** is disabled by default. ::

      # Enable this indexer
      waybackIndexer.enabled=false
      # Frequency of checks on the merged folder (milliseconds)
      waybackIndexer.waittime=1000
      # Time to wait for the file to be indexed before giving up (milliseconds)
      waybackIndexer.timeout=30000
      # Location of the folder Wayback is watching for auto indexing
      waybackIndexer.waybackInputFolder=/usr/local/wct/wayback/store
      # Location of the folder where Wayback places merged indexes
      waybackIndexer.waybackMergedFolder=/usr/local/wct/wayback/index-data/merged
      # Location of the folder where Wayback places failed indexes
      waybackIndexer.waybackFailedFolder=/usr/local/wct/wayback/index-data/failed
      # Create soft links instead of copies inside waybackInputFolder to save space
      waybackIndexer.useSymLinks=false

   **PywbIndexer** configures WCT to make copies of the WARC files and ingest them to
   the **pywbIndexer.wb-manager.store** for automatic indexing by an installed PyWB instance. The **wb-manager** command of PyWB will be called to **add** the WARC files to PyWB. **wb-manager** is a command line tool for managing common collection operations. You need to install **wb-manager** (The process of acquiring and installing wb-manager is outside the scope of this document).
   The **PywbIndexer** is enabled by default. ::
      
      # Enable this indexer
      pywbIndexer.enable=true
      # Location of the folder where WARC files and indexes are stored
      pywbIndexer.wb-manager.store=/usr/local/wct/pywb
      # The collection name of the archive for WARC files
      pywbIndexer.wb-manager.coll=my-web-archive

   **CDXIndexer** generates a CDX index file in the same folder as the ARC/WARC files. When a target
   instance is submitted to the archive, the CDX index will be copied along with the ARC/WARC file(s).
   The CDX format can be specified using the **format** variable. The default format is supported by the
   most commonly used tools. This indexer is enabled by default. ::

      # CDXIndexer
      # Enable this indexer
      cdxIndexer.enabled=true
      # Set the cdx format (most common nowadays is the 11-field format: N b a m s k r M S V g)
      cdxIndexer.format=N b a m s k r M S V g


-  Archive Type

   This section of the file specifies the location where Archives are stored on the file system.
   The Digital Asset store holds these files for a period of time before they are purged.
   See the Webapp configuration for the purge parameters. ::

      arcDigitalAssetStoreService.archive=fileArchive

Using the File Archive Adapter (Default option)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **FileArchive** writes files to a file system when they are
archived. This directory should be permanent storage that is backed up,
as these files are the definitive web archives that user wishes to store
for prosperity. ::

      # FileSystemArchive Adapter directory if using the File System Archive component
      fileArchive.archiveRepository=/usr/local/wct/repository
      # list of files added to the SIP for the File archive
      fileArchive.archiveLogReportFiles=crawl.log,progress-statistics.log,local-errors.log,runtime-errors.log,uri-errors.log,hosts-report.txt,mimetype-report.txt,responsecode-report.txt,seeds-report.txt,processors-report.txt
      fileArchive.archiveLogDirectory=logs
      fileArchive.archiveReportDirectory=reports
      fileArchive.archiveArcDirectory=arcs



Using other Archive Adapters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Other archive adapters may be specified by modifying the **arcDigitalAssetStoreService.archive** property.
Current available types are fileArchive, omsArchive, dpsArchive.

For more information on *dpsArchive*, see  :doc:`Rosetta DPS Configuration Guide <rosetta-dps-configuration-guide>`.

Using the screenshot generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Web Curator Tool is able to generate screenshots of seed URLs for Target Instances. Screenshots are generated from 
the live version and harvested version of each web page that corresponds to a seed URL in the Target Instance. 

For information on setting up and configuring this feature 
see :doc:`Harvest Screenshot Configuration Guide <harvest-screenshot-configuration-guide>`


Harvest Agent - application.properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are common configuration options for the Heritrix 3 Harvest Agent, adjusted
via the **application.properties** file.

-  Harvest Agent Name

   **harvestAgent.name** defines the visible name for the Harvest Agent, that is seen throughout
   the Webapp UI. All Harvest Agent names must be unique within a single Webapp instance. ::

      harvestAgent.name=Local Agent H3

-  Concurrent Harvests

   **harvestAgent.maxHarvests** defines the maximum number of concurrent harvests that a Harvest
   Agent can run. Take into account the available server resources when increasing this setting. ::

      harvestAgent.maxHarvests=5

-  Harvest Recovery

   The **attemptHarvestRecovery** is responsible for triggering a harvest recovery process
   in the Heritrix 3 Harvest Agent. This checks for running harvests in Webapp and Heritrix 3
   and resumes them. This allows for restarting of the H3 Harvest Agent without orphaning
   the running jobs in Heritrix 3. ::

      # whether to attempt to recover running harvests from H3 instance on startup.
      harvestAgent.attemptHarvestRecovery=true

-  Allowed Agencies

   **harvestAgent.allowedAgencies** allows restricting of harvests belonging to specific Agencies
   within WCT. This can limit a Harvest Agent to users and crawls within a designated Agency. ::

      # a comma separated list of WCT Agencies that are allowed to harvest with this Agent.
      # an empty list, allows any agency to harvest.
      harvestAgent.allowedAgencies=

-  System Checks

   The three checker beans allow the Harvest Agent to monitor Disk, Processor and Memory.
   Each of the checkers are configurable to allow different alert and error thresholds.
   A Notification event will be sent on either the alert or error threshold being exceeded. ::

    #MemoryChecker

    # The amount of memory in KB that can be used before a warning
    notification is sent
    memoryChecker.warnThreshold=512000
    # The amount of memory in KB that can be used before an error
    notification is sent
    memoryChecker.errorThreshold=640000

    #ProcessorCheck

    # The minimum percentage of processor available before a warning
    notification is sent
    processorCheck.warnThreshold=30
    # The minimum percentage of processor available before an error
    notification is sent
    processorCheck.errorThreshold=20

    #DiskSpaceChecker

    # the percentage of disk used before a warning notification is sent
    diskSpaceChecker.warnThreshold=80
    # the percentage of disk used before an error notification is sent
    diskSpaceChecker.errorThreshold=90

   *Note, the processorCheck bean actually runs the following Unix command line utility to
   determine processor utilisation - (this command fails when running on Windows hosts);* ::

      "sar -u"


Setting up Heritrix 3
=============================

Integration with WCT
-----------------------

|image3|

Heritrix 3 (H3) integrates with WCT through the H3 Harvest Agent. As an interface between the WCT Webapp and
Heritrix 3, the Harvest Agent has three primary functions:

- actioning crawl commands from the WCT UI (start, stop, pause, abort).
- retrieving job status updates from Heritrix 3, to send onto Webapp.
- copying completed harvest files from Heritrix 3 job directory to the Digital Asset Store.

*Heritrix 3 is a standalone application external from WCT.*

The H3 Harvest Agent requires a corresponding Heritrix 3 instance to be running. If Heritrix 3 is not
runnning then new Target Instances will fail to start crawling.

Prerequisites
--------------

- **Java** - A minimum of Java 7 is required. However due to an https issue with
  H3, it is recommended to use Java 8.

  *For simplicity, it is recommended to run Heritrix 3 using the same Java version
  as WCT, which is now 64bit Java 8.*

Download
---------

Information on the latest stable versions of Heritrix 3 are available on Github and Maven Central.

The Heritrix 3 Github wiki contains a section detailing the current master builds
available https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki#master-builds

For releases, see:

   - https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/releases
   - http://builds.archive.org/maven2/org/archive/heritrix/heritrix/

Building from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Optionally, Heritrix 3 can be built from source. Use the Github repository:
https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/

*Maven is required to build the project*

The build of the Heritrix3 crawler is done from the directory that contains the
cloned Heritrix3 github repository.

It's recommended to skip the tests when building the Heritrix3 crawler as they
can take a considerable amount of time to run (many minutes to hours).
::

    mvn clean install -DskipTests=true

The build produces a `heritrix-<heritrix-version>-SNAPSHOT-dist.zip` in
`./dist/target`.

Unzip this zip in the parent folder of `$HERITRIX_HOME`.

It is recommended to run Heritrix 3 as close to it's corresponding H3 Harvest
Agent as possible, i.e. the same server. Running Heritrix 3 and the H3 Harvest
Agent on separate servers has not been tested.

Memory
~~~~~~~~~

-  If Heritrix 3 and it's corresponding Harvest Agent are running on the same server
   as WCT Webapp and DAS, then Heritrix 3 may need greater memory allocation.

-  Or depending on how many concurrent harvests you want to allow the H3 Harvest Agent
   to run, increasing the memory allocation for Heritrix 3 might be required.

Place the following lines near the top of `heritrix-3.3.0/bin/heritrix`

::

    #Java Configuration
    JAVA_OPTS=" -Xms256m -Xmx1024m"

Or set the JAVA_OPTS environment variable on the command line prior to running the Heritrix startup script:

::

    export JAVA_OPTS=" -Xms256m -Xmx1024m"


Jobs directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Heritrix 3 creates a folder in it's job directory for each new job. After the registering
of a new job in Heritrix 3 by the H3 Harvest Agent, the Agent completes the initial setup
by copying the crawl profile (``crawler-beans.cxml``) and seeds (``seeds.txt``) into the
new job folder.

The system user running *harvest-agent-h3.jar* **must have read and write access** to the
top level jobs directory (and any child job folders) for Heritrix 3.

On completion or termination of a Heritrix 3 job, the H3 Harvest Agent will attempt to
clean up by removing the job folder.

*The Heritrix 3 jobs directory must remain separate from the H3 Harvest Agent*
**harvestAgent.baseHarvestDirectory**. *If the same directory is used, an empty profile
will be given to Heritrix 3, causing a job to fail.*

Scripts directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The H3 scripts directory is used for storing pre-defined Heritrix 3 scripts (js, groovy, beanshell)
that WCT makes available for use through the scripting console window. These scripts can be run
against harvests running on Heritrix 3.

- The directory needs to be readable by the system user running WCT Webapp.
- The directory path needs to be set in **application.properties** inside Webapp.

For more information, please see:

- https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3/wiki/Heritrix3-Useful-Scripts

- https://heritrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#execute-script-in-job


Default profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are only a select group of Heritrix 3 profile settings available through the WCT
UI to configure. If configuration of additional settings is required, then the default
Heritrix 3 profile used by WCT can be edited. **This is only recommened for advanced users.**

The default profile is located in the project source::

    webcurator-webapp/src/main/resources/defaultH3Profile.cxml

*The Webapp component must be re-built to include any changes to the default profile.*

If you don't want to do a rebuild, you can edit the file in the webapp binary, which can be found here::

    webcurator-webapp.war/WEB-INF/classes/defaultH3Profile.cxml

Care must be taken if editing the default profile xml. The WCT Heritrix 3 profile editor
relies on a select group of xml elements being present and correctly formatted. The following
list of xml elements must remain untouched in the xml. Other properties can be edited.

- Where properties are shown, WCT edits those values
- Where just the bean is shown, with no properties, WCT edits the entire bean element.

Proxy Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Configuring Heritrix 3 for proxy access also requires editing of the default
Heritrix 3 profile. Please refer to the preceding section for the details and caveats
of editing the default profile.

To configure web proxy access the following properties in the ``fetchHTTP`` bean can configured::

    <bean id="fetchHttp" class="org.archive.modules.fetcher.FetchHTTP">
        <!-- <property name="httpProxyHost" value="" /> -->
        <!-- <property name="httpProxyPort" value="0" /> -->
        <!-- <property name="httpProxyUser" value="" /> -->
        <!-- <property name="httpProxyPassword" value="" /> -->
    </bean>


Running Heritrix 3
------------------------

Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the H3 Harvest Agent is configured to connect to H3 using:

   - username: admin
   - password: admin

If you wish to run H3 with different credentials, then update **application.properties** in
harvest-agent-h3.jar to reflect that.

Starting Heritrix 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Linux/Unix**
  ``./heritrix-3.3.0/bin/heritrix -a admin:admin -j /mnt/wct-harvester/dev/heritrix3/jobs``

- **Windows**
  ``./heritrix-3.3.0/bin/heritrix.cmd -a admin:admin -j /mnt/wct-harvester/dev/heritrix3/jobs``

Stopping Heritrix 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heritrix 3 can be stopped using two methods:

- **Via the UI**. This will notify you of any jobs still running.

- **Kill the Java process**. It is your responsibility to check for and safely stop any
  running jobs.


Operation of Heritrix 3
------------------------

Jobs
~~~~~~

Two types of jobs are created in Heritrix 3 by the H3 Harvest Agent:

- **Crawl Jobs** - standard crawl jobs for WCT Target Instances. Created for the
  duration of running crawls.

- **Profile Validation Jobs** - a single re-used job to validate Heritrix 3 profiles
  created/edited in WCT-Core.


Heritrix management UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Accessible locally via https://localhost:8443/engine


Logging
~~~~~~~~

The Heritrix 3 application log is located in it's base directory. ::

   heritrix-3.3.0/heritrix_out.log

Additional notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Harvest Agent implementation for Heritrix 3 handles the creation and cleanup 
up of jobs within the Heritrix 3.x instance. You should only see job directories 
within Heritrix while a harvest is running or waiting to be completed. Once the 
harvest is complete and WCT has transferred the assets, logs and reports to the 
Store then the Heritrix job is torn down and directory deleted. The only occasions
where a Heritrix job directory will not be cleaned up is if a job fails to
build/start or an error has occurred during the harvest. This allows you to
investigate the Heritrix job log to determine the cause.


Interacting with Heritrix 3 directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heritrix 3 can be operated directly (outside of WCT). Either use the UI or REST
API to manually start a crawl.

Curl can be used to send actions to H3. See
https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/spaces/Heritrix/pages/5735014/Heritrix+3.x+API+Guide
for details on how this is done.

Harvest related logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following locations contain logging related to Heritrix 3 harvests.

-  The directory the harvest-agent-h3.jar file is run from, e.g. ::

      /opt/app/wct/harvest-agent-h3/logs/wct-agent-h3.log

-  The H3 application directory, e.g. ::

      /opt/app/heritrix-3.0.0/heritrix_out.log

-  The H3 jobs directory. The default jobs location or as specified in the H3 start command, e.g. ::

      /opt/app/heritrix-3.0.0/jobs/19827347/job.log
      /opt/app/heritrix-3.0.0/jobs/19827347/latest/logs/

      /mnt/wct-harvester/dev/heritrix3/jobs/19827347/job.log
      /mnt/wct-harvester/dev/heritrix3/jobs/19827347/latest/logs


Jobs won't build or crawl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Check the available logs. Investigate the crawl log to determine if H3 started
   to crawl the seed URLs.

-  Is the `seed.txt` and `crawler-beans.cxml` being created in the harvest
   agent base directory, is it being transferred to the H3 job dir location?

-  Check file permissions for job directory and `seed.txt`, `crawler-beans.cxml`
   files.

-  Does the harvest profile contain a valid contact URL?

Jobs fail
~~~~~~~~~
-   Fail to build
-   Fail during crawl

TODO How to solve.

Old job dirs not being removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Occasionaly there are nfs hidden files that prevent these folders from deleting
fully. Make sure all hidden files are removed.

OpenSSL errors with Solaris and Java 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If running on Solaris with Java 7 and you get openssl errors when the Harvest
Agent tries to connect the Heritrix 3.x, try running Heritrix 3.x with Java 8.

Copying issues with larger harvests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If running Apache Tomcat with 32bit Java 7, you may experience issues with
larger harvests copying between the Harvest Agent and the Store on completion of
a crawl. This was resolved by running Apache Tomcat with 64bit Java 7.


Graceful shutdown and restart
=============================

The system can be taken down manually or automatically for maintenance.

To shut down and restart the Webapp and the DAS, but leave the harvesters
running (so that they can continue harvesting when the Webapp and DAS are
unavailable), follow these steps:

   1. Admin or script shuts down Webapp and DAS processes on server.

   2. Admin or script shuts down database.

   3. Admin or script does backup or required maintenance. WCT Harvest Agents continue harvesting.

   4. Admin or script starts database.

   5. Admin or script starts Webapp and DAS.

   6. WCT Harvest Agents re-register themselves with Webapp, and then copy any completed harvests to DAS and notify Webapp.

To shut down everything including the harvest agents, then the procedure
is:

   1. Wait until all Harvest Agents have no crawl jobs running and shut them
      down. This can be best achieved by halting all Scheduled and Queued target
      instances using the 'Calendar' icon on the Harvester Configuration screen,
      and then waiting until the currently running jobs finish.

   2. Admin shuts down Webapp and DAS processes on server.

   3. Admin shuts down database.

Restart the system again in the reverse order.

*Note, when you shut down a Harvest Agent, all running jobs are lost. If
you pause a harvest then it stays in a paused state on the harvest agent, and
is similarly lost when you shut down. These jobs can be successfully resumed
via the harvest recovery process on startup, only if a crawl is still running
in Heritrix 3.*

Appendix A: Creating a truststore and importing a certificate
=======================================================================

To create a truststore and import a certificate:

1. First export your public key from your Directory server.

   -  Refer to the documentation from your Directory server, in order to
      complete this task.

   -  If possible export the certificate as a binary file. We will
      assume your exported certificate is called mydirectorycert.der

2. Create a truststore and dummy key. Using the keytool provided with the java SDK::

    keytool -genkey -dname "cn=dummy, ou=dummy, o=dummy, c=US" -alias dummy -keypass dummy -keystore /var/wctcore/ssl/wct.ts -storepass password

5. You need to import the X509 certificate for your directory server::

    keytool -import -file mydirectorycert.der -keystore
    /var/wctcore/ssl/wct.ts
